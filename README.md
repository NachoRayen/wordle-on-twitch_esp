# Wordle on Twitch

A wordle-like game that reads Twitch chat for guesses and gives points. 

Add [https://wordle-on-twitch.vercel.app/?channel=***YourChannelName***](https://wordle-on-twitch.vercel.app/?channel=YourChannelName) as a browser source in your streaming application. Recommended size is 1920x1080 and downsize to fit your layout.

Note that the game is not synchronized across instances, so the only meaningful way to play is for the streamer to load in the game as a browser source or share their screen to play. Giving the URL to people in chat will not show them the same game as the streamer.

## Scoring

- 1 point for every new letter that is not in the word.
- 2 points for finding a new letter that is in the word but in the wrong place. (Yellow)
- 3 points for guessing a new letter in the right place. (Green)
- 1 point for finding the right place for a yellow letter (Yellow â†’ Green)
- Otherwise, no points for letters that were already guessed by someone.
- 5 bonus points for solving the word.
